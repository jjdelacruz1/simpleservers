This is an exercise from the DigitalCrafts Flex Cohort where I have linked the backend to the frontend so that a simple counter app
will increment and decrement a count.

This exercise uses express for routing which tells the count how to be incremented and decremented. A reset route was also
added for additional functionality.

The logic was helped figured out with Alvin Ng to make sure it works properly!!!
